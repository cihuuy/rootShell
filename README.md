# RootShell

Tool to access another computer from your primary system.

`server.py` runs on your computer or a cloud server
`client.py` runs on a subsystem that you want to access. To make it easier one can make a executable file and run it on the subsystem. 

Once `client.py` is online from the subsystem, `server.py` can access the subsystem remotely from their system. 

The `IP Address` in the subsystem `client.py` file needs to be updated based on the client's IP Address so that `server.py` can connect.
